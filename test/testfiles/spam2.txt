HECTOR

GARTH

GARTH
*LIST:
*KICK:Barry80
I feel sure I left my mythical flaming sword somewhere around here.
HECTOR
Are you sure? It does seem like an odd place to keep deadly mythical flaming sword.
GARTH
You know nothing Hector Barker.
HECTOR
We've been searching for ages. I really don't think they're here.
Suddenly, WARWICK appears, holding a pair of mythical flaming sword.
WARWICK

WARWICK
No please! All I did was set aflame a bunch of village!

WARWICK
*LIST:
*KICK:Barry158
Ah well, it had to be worth a try.
WARWICK tries to grab the mythical flaming sword but GARTH dodges out of the way.
GARTH
Who's the daddy now? Huh? Huh?
Unexpectedly, WARWICK slumps to the ground.
HECTOR
Did he just faint?
GARTH
I think so. Well that's disappointing. I was rather hoping for a more dramatic conclusion, involving my deadly mythical flaming sword.
GARTH crouches over WARWICK's body.
*LIST:
HECTOR
Be careful, Garth. It could be a trick.
GARTH
No, it's not a trick. It appears that... It would seem... Warwick Parker is dead!

HECTOR claps his hands.
HECTOR
*LIST:
*KICK:Barry55
So your mythical flaming sword did save the day, after all.

ALISON
You are their hero.
The village bow to GARTH.
GARTH
*LIST:
*KICK:Barry111
There is no need to bow to me. I seek no worship. The knowledge that Warwick Parker will never set aflame village ever again, is enough for me.
ALISON
You are humble as well as brave!
One of the village passes GARTH a poweful braceletALISON
I think they want you to have it, as a symbol of their gratitude.
GARTH
I couldn't possibly.
Pause.

GARTH smiles for a few seconds, but then looks defiant.
*LIST:
*KICK:Barry13
GARTH
Well you can't have me.
ALISON
WHAT?
GARTH
You had no faith in me. You had to see my scare a dragon to death before you would believe in me. I don't want a lover like that.
ALISON
But...
GARTH
Please leave. I want to spend time with the one person who stayed with me through thick and thin - my best friend, Hector.
*LIST:
HECTOR grins.
ALISON
But...
HECTOR
You heard the gentleman. Now be off with you. Skidaddle! Shoo!
ALISON
Garth?
GARTH
I'm sorry Alison, but I think you should skidaddle.
ALISON leaves.
*LIST:
*KICK:Barry136
HECTOR turns to GARTH.
HECTOR
Did you mean that? You know ... that I'm your best friend?
GARTH
Of course you are!
The two walk off arm in arm.
Suddenly HECTOR stops.
HECTOR
When I said I'm afraid of dust, you know I was just trying to distract the dragon don't you?

In his right hand he raises a golden sword and in his lefts he holds a Libra to illustrate the balance of good and evil. Bottom right, there's an oval escutcheon/shield with the Teutonic Cross on a white background on the right side.

History
ColonizationThe current area of the Elztal was populated by Germanic peoples in its prehistoric time. Today there are 14 burial mounds which witnesses it. The emergence of this burial mounds are dated on the middle of the 1st Millennium BC. At the time of the Romans ran the limes through the Elz Village. The limes was strengthened from the Romans with a fort (today known as: Fort of Neckarburken). The Germanic settlers in Elztal were shocked from this changes and relied into the security of the forests and woods of their home area. In addition, the Romans strengthened their fort with nearby inns (Villa rustica) and a separated Vicus (camp village) for its military troops. The Romans in the Elztal were eliminated in 260 AD by the Alemannic Germans. In 497 AD, the Franken conquered the territorium and founded the villages Aue amnis (Auerbach), Dallau, Neckar Castellum (Neckarburken) and Miles Militis Flumen (Rittersbach). On the occasion of foundations of Frankish noblemen to the monastery Lorsch are the first written references of the four settlements in the Franconian Lorsch Codex (Lorscher Codex). In this Codex, the villages are named:
Dallau (772 AD) => Dalaheim (Talheim)
Neckarburken (774 AD) => Borocheim (Burgheim)
Rittersbach (783 AD) => Rodinsburon (Ruodis Bure)
Auerbach (791 AD) => UrbachIn the 9th century AD, the villages has connections to the catholic Cyriak Monastery (Cyriaksstift) in Worms-Neuhausen and the Diocese of Worms which enlarged it influence after a gift of Emperor Otto II. So the Diocese of Worms possessed the Mosbach Abbey with possession in 23 cities and villages.

Middle AgesIn the Middle Ages divided the society in different classes. In these time ascents some of the Elztal peoples into the 1st society class. One of them was Herr von Heinriet (1336 AD) who owned the Festivals of Dallau and a lot of land. After any years the Herr von Heinriet impoverished and developed to robber barons. In the extermination campaign 1356 AD of the Mainzer Archbishop Gerlach von Nassau against Albrecht Schenk von Limpurg in Lohrbach was the water castle (Wasserschloß) of Dallau in order of Karl IV conquered. In this campaign Dallau was devastated and its settlers and peoples murdered by the order from Karl IV. Gerlach von Nassau got the rights to reestablishment of a new city on the Dallau territory. But he never realized this right. After the Death of Gerlach in 1371 AD, the Herr von Heinriets owned now the Possessions of the Elztal villages again. These were sold to Cunz Münch von Rosenberg in 1380 AD. During this sale was Muckental in its first time mentioned. In the 14th and early 15th century was the Elztal owned by Herren von Weinsberg, Herren von Hirschhorn and Albrecht Schenk von Limpurg. The Rineck Farm between Dallau and Muckental got 1726 AD a bad reputation and was now known as an infertile farm territory. In the Lohrbach it got nicknames like Wild Plants (lauther Wildnus), Bad Odenwald Field (schlecht Odenwäldisch Feld) and Desert Territory (Wüsteney). The farm included an area of 200 Morgen for sheep grazing. The Royal Palatinate hereditary of Mannheim prompted the reclamation of the barren land of the Rineck Farm. Fifty years later, the territory of the farm was issued to settle. The settlers received some own land and had to submit their natural produces and yields to the Lohrbach basement office. The old farm was now renamed in Altrineck. New nicknames were Althof and Rühlingerhof. The settlement of Rineck was 1784 AD renamed into Neurineck. The settlers of this new settlement consisted of tinkers, Broom binders, basket makers, itinerant entertainers, musicians and mole catchers. A lot of them were deported from their former municipalities; they were known as Rielinger. The first mayor of the municipality was Franz Holzschuh (29 August 1788).
Leiningen and BadenThrough contributions and accommodation in the time of the French Wars and the losing of the left-side-territories of the Rhine, the Elz Valley villages are hard burdened. So the nobles led a political realignment for southwestern territories within the Holy Roman Empire (Heiliges Römisches Reich Deutscher Nation). In this way the Elz Valley villages were 1803 AD incorporated into the Principality of Leiningen. In 1806 the Principality dissolved and was now a part of Baden.
1803 confirmed the former reputation from the Rineck Farm. Infertile soil and negligent field orders caused a famine. Begging, thefts, poaching and armed raids were now on the agenda and shifted the whole area into fear and turmoil. All surrounding villages complained of the many robberies and thefts at the courts. But nothing was done. Until 1838, the first complaint of the Mosbach supreme court reached the Baden District Government. In this, the settlers of the municipality New Rineck were accused of being thieves, crooks, arsonists and vagabonds because they refused to work. From the people there were already claims to urge the settlers of New Rineck to emigrate to the USA. After lengthy negotiations with the surrounding municipalities this demand was realized. The first transport with 168 involuntary emigrants left New Rineck on 3 October 1849. The second Group left New Rineck on 11 May 1850 with 200 emigrants and the third Group left the municipality on 13 May 1850 with a group of 235 emigrants. On 2 December 1850, the municipality New Rineck dissolved. Ferdinand Scipio acquired the land in 1856 and created a farm with an area of 500 Morgen. Currently is the Rineck Grange owned by the Baron of Gemmingen-Hornberg.
The road (today's B 27) through the Elz Valley were expanded in 1847 AD to improve the local market conditions. Another important project was the Railway Mosbach-Neckarelz to Osterburken which is today very frequented by students, travelers and not mobile persons.
But there were no big changes after the realizing the projects. So the villages was remained agriculturally.
World Wars and post-war yearsWithin the time of World War I, there were no changes and no happenings within the Elz Valley villages. The Second World War caused a lot of suffering and deaths in most of the settled families. A tombstone in the center of Dallau near to Volksbank and the water castle testify to the shocking happening of an inevitable war.
The first structural changes occurred during the last three war years and in the immediate postwar period of the transitional government. by the inclusion of refugees from the destroyed cities, the population of the villages rose. In the post-war years settled again a number of displaced from the eastern territories in the Elz Valley villages. New development zones and industrial estates have now been expelled and contributed to structural change.
It needed a long time to recover from the impacts of the recent World War. Every village of today's Elztal was a self-governed municipality within the Mosbach district of the North Baden county (Nordbaden).
The first sports facilities were built in the late 1960s:
1967: Sportzentrum Dallau (sports center)
*LIST:
1968: Elzbergstadion and Elzberghalle (Elzberg stadium and Elzberg gym)
As part of the district reform on 1 January 1973, Auerbach, Dallau, Muckental and Neckarburken founded the new municipality Elztal with Dallau as district office.
Educational facilitiesAuerbach, Rittersbach, Neckarburken and Dallau have their own primary schools called Grundschule. The secondary school (Hauptschule) of Elztal is in Dallau behind the official municipality town hall (Rathaus). The secondary school in the Elztal (Hauptschule mit Werkrealschule; translated: secondary school with modern secondary handicraft workshop) is coupled with a handicraft workshop to learn the practical part in manual work (compulsory), technology (compulsory; election in the last year because compulsory), art (compulsory), home economics (election in the last year) and cooking (compulsory; election in the last year because compulsory). This is incidentally not a standard on German secondary schools.
Within the municipality are three evangelical and two Catholic nursery schools called Kindergarten.

Sights and special features
The water castle in Dallau
The water castle of ElztalThe water castle of Dallau was bought up by the municipality Elztal in 1974 AD. It is the only remnant of a former and much larger water castle. The water castle was built in the earlier 12th century AD from knights of the Teutonic Order. Particularly striking[according to whom?] are the circular tower and the palace room with a medieval staircase gable. The both fountains near the water castle were built in the 16th century by farmers. At Christmas time, it is possible to go inside the water castle for the annual flu issue of the municipality.
Religious institutionsIn Dallau the evangelical and the Catholic church are side by side. The churches are surrounded by other historical buildings as for example the catholic parish office and the Protestant schoolhouse.
The Protestant church was built in 1750 AD and expanded 1857 AD.
The Catholic Church St. Maria Immaculate was consecrated on 9 May 1737. In 1985, the transverse building was complemented and the old choir renewed. Because the historic stained glass window in the old building had no Marie reference, the new parts were built with a baroque statue of Marie and other Marie symbols. The re-consecration of the church was held on 10 May 1987.
In Neckarburken are forming the local church (built 1775) with its church tower (built 1811) and the surrounded half-timbered houses a beautiful a historic ensemble. Opposite is the former rectory which was built in 1818. In addition, you will find one of the very rare historical bread-back positions (from 1809) and a historic lime kiln, which was restored in 2006.
*LIST:
In Auerbach are a Protestant church which was renewed 1789, a Catholic church and several historic half-timbered buildings. These include the historic Gasthaus Lamm, the old railway station (today a S-Bahn station) and the old schoolhouse.
In 1886 the new George Church designed by Ludwig Maier replaced the former one. The predecessor was built in the 14th century AD and was made of wood. The newer one is in the New Romanized Style from Ludwig Maier consists mainly of sandstones from the surrounding mountains. In the case of a renovation 1969/1970 AD inside the church were simplified the frescoes simplified. Another renovation held in 2002.
On the Hill of Urns there was a great monastery in medieval times. Certificates for this are easy to find. So there are a lot of remains in the Große Kappel and in the Kleine Kappel. More of the wall remains are inside the Nature Reserve between the Urnbergstraße and the underlying track.    St. Maria Immaculata in Dallau

Walking and hikingThe municipality Elztal offers many interesting routes for walking and to rest. One favorite route is the small circuit in Dallau. It is especially nice in spring and summer. Parking is available at Krähenwaldparkplatz near to the Märchenwald.
*LIST:
*KICK:Barry90
On the circuit there are a lot of branchings and inconspicuous forest paths. The first peculiarity on the circuit is a hidden Tulip tree on the right side of the way. A few hundred meters along is a three-compartment crossing on the left side. The first way is only a path and leads to the oldest tree of the municipality. The second leads to an old and small chapel which is on a brook and a little bridge over it. On the other side one has the choice to go inside the Mariental on the left or the rest of the circuit on the right. From the main road you will reach a Y-crossing. So you have the choice to go to the right or to the left, but as it is circular you can go either way.
One can then walk through Mariental. There are a lot of rare grasses, plants and bird species. In this valley can be seen the power of a volcano. You'll find a lot of big hurled magma lumps coming from the Katzenbuckel.
Other popular routes for walking are the hiking:    Dallau – Auerbach
        Forest street parallel to B292 and then around the Cattle-Horse-Ranch (former Nike-Stellung / Missile defense base) along the streets
        Valley route passing the shelter and the Cattle-Horse-Ranch (former Nike-Stellung / Missile defense base)    Dallau to Lower Schfflenz
        Valley route passing the shelter and the Cattle-Horse-Ranch (former Nike-Stellung / Missile defense base) and then passing the barbecue placeFor biking there is the old Roman road between the Elz Valley and the Schefflenz Valley recommended. One can start in Mosbach and end in Walldürn. Those preferring valley routes can use the signposted standard route from Mosbach through the Elz Valley up to Walldürn or Osterburken.

    7 External linksEarly life and educationBratton was born William Charles Schneider in Los Angeles, and grew up in Coarsegold, California, a small town near Yosemite National Park.[1] When Bratton was two, his father died when he was working on an airplane that exploded while he was stationed in Hawaii.[citation needed]
His grandparents, mother and father were musicians, and he took a liking to music at a very early age. At 13, he ordered his first guitar, a Silvertone guitar, from a Sears mail-order catalog. He became a professional musician during his high school and college years.
Musical career
Early yearsBratton adopted his new name while on a global excursion as a traveling musician. He traveled through Europe, Africa and the Middle East. He played guitar at a large folk festival in Israel, appearing with his group the Young Californians. Fellow American and guitarist Warren Entner witnessed Bratton's performance and asked to give him a call when he got back to the United States. In 1966, they formed a partnership and recruited the remaining members needed for their group, the 13th Floor. Bratton played lead guitar, Rick Coonce played drums, Entner played rhythm guitar and Kenny Fukomoto played bass. The Young Californians recorded a demo and sent it to Dunhill, a new record company headed by Lou Adler.
The Grass Roots
Main article: The Grass Roots
Bratton playing at The Office Convention in Scranton, Pennsylvania, in 2007Producers/songwriters P. F. Sloan and Steve Barri heard the demo and liked it. They needed new band members for a folk-rock group that they had created in 1965. The 13th Floor lost their bass player to the draft during this time, and quickly recruited Rob Grill, changing the band's name to the "Grass Roots" for prior name recognition. The group went straight to the Top 10 with the song "Let's Live for Today" in 1967 and toured the United States. Iconic hit songs such as "Midnight Confessions" cemented the group's standing as major contributors to the rock-music scene.[2]
The Grass Roots had top songwriters offering their best songs to them and wrote many songs themselves. For their major songs, music on the recordings was played by the LA studio musicians known as the Wrecking Crew.[3] Bratton co-wrote the songs "Beatin' Round the Bush", "No Exit" and "Hot Bright Lights", and self-composed "Dinner for Eight" and "House of Stone". He sang lead vocals on "This Precious Time" and "Dinner for Eight". Bratton played with the group on its albums Let's Live for Today, Feelings, Golden Grass (a compilation) and Lovin' Things. Three of the albums charted, and Golden Grass received a gold record certification. He took part in ten of the group's singles, eight of which charted; "Midnight Confessions" received a gold record certification.
*LIST:
The Grass Roots played at the Fantasy Fair and Magic Mountain Music Festival on Sunday, June 11, 1967, during the "Summer of Love" as their top-ten hit "Let's Live for Today" was hitting the airwaves.[4] Though the music festival occurred before the Monterey Pop Festival, it was not filmed as was the latter festival (see List of electronic music festivals). On Sunday, October 27, 1968, the group played at the San Francisco Pop Festival and then played at the Los Angeles Pop Festival and Miami Pop Festival in December as the top-ten hit "Midnight Confessions" was becoming popular.
In April 1969, Bratton became frustrated by Dunhill's refusal to allow the band to write its own songs and play the instruments on its records (although the members did play alone at concerts). After a disastrous appearance at the Fillmore West in April 1969, Bratton was asked to leave the band.[3]
Solo yearsIn 2001 and 2002, Bratton released three albums showcasing his solo recordings since the 1960s with the assistance of Peter White. In 2007, he presented an induction award to the Wrecking Crew at the Musicians Hall of Fame. In 2008, he released another album of new music with producer Jon Tiven. In 2010, Bratton released an album titled "Bounce Back" with producer Dave Way. In 2011, Bratton released an album of greatest hits from his first three solo albums, titled "Demo". In 2010 and 2012, Bratton performed live at the SXSW festival. In 2013, Bratton released an original work in three acts as an audio biography titled Tell Me About It. Songs ranged from those recently written to pieces that he had written decades before. Bratton states that he listens to much jazz and classical music.[5]
On January 18, 2014, Bratton joined his friend Zachary Scot Johnson for a duet for the 500th consecutive day of the thesongadayproject on YouTube.[6]
Acting career
Bratton in 2009Bratton began to pursue an acting career in 1979.

In the episode "Booze Cruise", he speaks about his time with the Grass Roots on a deleted scene. In the series finale, his character is revealed to have been in the Grass Roots as well as committing many crimes. This episode also features Bratton performing his song All The Faces.
In 2008, he appeared in a short film with Kyle Gass titled Just One Of The Gynos, which won an award for best short film at the 2008 Malibu International Film Festival. He appeared in the feature film Labor Pains in 2009. His recent film projects are The Ghastly Love of Johnny X, written, produced and directed by Paul Bunnell; I Am Ben, written, produced and directed by Mathew Brady and Gaelan Connell; and Terri produced by David Guy Levy. Terri was selected by the Sundance Film Festival 2011 to appear in the US dramatic competition. It was one of only 16 films selected from 1,102 submissions to the US dramatic category.[8] In 2012, he appeared as special guest star in Staged with Brandon Olive who appeared with him in Just One Of The Gynos. In 2013, he starred in Saving Lincoln, a biography set during the American Civil War.[7]

    7 External linksEarly life and educationBratton was born William Charles Schneider in Los Angeles, and grew up in Coarsegold, California, a small town near Yosemite National Park.[1] When Bratton was two, his father died when he was working on an airplane that exploded while he was stationed in Hawaii.[citation needed]
His grandparents, mother and father were musicians, and he took a liking to music at a very early age. At 13, he ordered his first guitar, a Silvertone guitar, from a Sears mail-order catalog. He became a professional musician during his high school and college years.
Musical career
Early yearsBratton adopted his new name while on a global excursion as a traveling musician. He traveled through Europe, Africa and the Middle East. He played guitar at a large folk festival in Israel, appearing with his group the Young Californians. Fellow American and guitarist Warren Entner witnessed Bratton's performance and asked to give him a call when he got back to the United States. In 1966, they formed a partnership and recruited the remaining members needed for their group, the 13th Floor. Bratton played lead guitar, Rick Coonce played drums, Entner played rhythm guitar and Kenny Fukomoto played bass. The Young Californians recorded a demo and sent it to Dunhill, a new record company headed by Lou Adler.
The Grass Roots
Main article: The Grass Roots
Bratton playing at The Office Convention in Scranton, Pennsylvania, in 2007Producers/songwriters P. F. Sloan and Steve Barri heard the demo and liked it. They needed new band members for a folk-rock group that they had created in 1965. The 13th Floor lost their bass player to the draft during this time, and quickly recruited Rob Grill, changing the band's name to the "Grass Roots" for prior name recognition. The group went straight to the Top 10 with the song "Let's Live for Today" in 1967 and toured the United States. Iconic hit songs such as "Midnight Confessions" cemented the group's standing as major contributors to the rock-music scene.[2]
The Grass Roots had top songwriters offering their best songs to them and wrote many songs themselves. For their major songs, music on the recordings was played by the LA studio musicians known as the Wrecking Crew.[3] Bratton co-wrote the songs "Beatin' Round the Bush", "No Exit" and "Hot Bright Lights", and self-composed "Dinner for Eight" and "House of Stone". He sang lead vocals on "This Precious Time" and "Dinner for Eight". Bratton played with the group on its albums Let's Live for Today, Feelings, Golden Grass (a compilation) and Lovin' Things. Three of the albums charted, and Golden Grass received a gold record certification. He took part in ten of the group's singles, eight of which charted; "Midnight Confessions" received a gold record certification.
The Grass Roots played at the Fantasy Fair and Magic Mountain Music Festival on Sunday, June 11, 1967, during the "Summer of Love" as their top-ten hit "Let's Live for Today" was hitting the airwaves.[4] Though the music festival occurred before the Monterey Pop Festival, it was not filmed as was the latter festival (see List of electronic music festivals). On Sunday, October 27, 1968, the group played at the San Francisco Pop Festival and then played at the Los Angeles Pop Festival and Miami Pop Festival in December as the top-ten hit "Midnight Confessions" was becoming popular.

In April 1969, Bratton became frustrated by Dunhill's refusal to allow the band to write its own songs and play the instruments on its records (although the members did play alone at concerts). After a disastrous appearance at the Fillmore West in April 1969, Bratton was asked to leave the band.[3]
Solo yearsIn 2001 and 2002, Bratton released three albums showcasing his solo recordings since the 1960s with the assistance of Peter White. In 2007, he presented an induction award to the Wrecking Crew at the Musicians Hall of Fame. In 2008, he released another album of new music with producer Jon Tiven. In 2010, Bratton released an album titled "Bounce Back" with producer Dave Way. In 2011, Bratton released an album of greatest hits from his first three solo albums, titled "Demo". In 2010 and 2012, Bratton performed live at the SXSW festival. In 2013, Bratton released an original work in three acts as an audio biography titled Tell Me About It. Songs ranged from those recently written to pieces that he had written decades before. Bratton states that he listens to much jazz and classical music.[5]
On January 18, 2014, Bratton joined his friend Zachary Scot Johnson for a duet for the 500th consecutive day of the thesongadayproject on YouTube.[6]
Acting career
Bratton in 2009Bratton began to pursue an acting career in 1979. He has appeared in films such as Mask and Heart Like a Wheel.[7] He was a cast member, playing a fictional version of himself, on NBC's Emmy and SAG award-winning The Office. In the episode "Booze Cruise", he speaks about his time with the Grass Roots on a deleted scene. In the series finale, his character is revealed to have been in the Grass Roots as well as committing many crimes. This episode also features Bratton performing his song All The Faces.
In 2008, he appeared in a short film with Kyle Gass titled Just One Of The Gynos, which won an award for best short film at the 2008 Malibu International Film Festival. He appeared in the feature film Labor Pains in 2009. His recent film projects are The Ghastly Love of Johnny X, written, produced and directed by Paul Bunnell; I Am Ben, written, produced and directed by Mathew Brady and Gaelan Connell; and Terri produced by David Guy Levy. Terri was selected by the Sundance Film Festival 2011 to appear in the US dramatic competition. It was one of only 16 films selected from 1,102 submissions to the US dramatic category.[8] In 2012, he appeared as special guest star in Staged with Brandon Olive who appeared with him in Just One Of The Gynos. In 2013, he starred in Saving Lincoln, a biography set during the American Civil War.[7]

    7 External linksEarly yearsNguyen's family left South Vietnam during the fall of Saigon at the end of the Vietnam War, and he was born in a refugee center at Fort Chaffee in Fort Smith, Arkansas. He lived most of his childhood in the Gulf Coast town of Rockport, Texas. At Rockport-Fulton High School, Nguyen played middle linebacker and handled punting duties. Nguyen earned All-State honors as a punter. Nguyen was recruited and received scholarship offers from Michigan, UCLA, Notre Dame, Texas, and Florida. Nguyen eventually decided to play closer to home and chose Texas A&M University.
College careerNguyen attended Texas A&M University, where he played for the Texas A&M Aggies football team from 1995 to 1998. He battled the perception that he was too small to play linebacker for as long as he was involved in the game, despite his muscular 5'11", 238-pound frame. Proving critics wrong at an early stage, he finished his college career as the Aggies' career record holder with 51 consecutive starts, 517 career tackles, and a 10.7 tackles-per-game average. His 517 career tackles are a Texas A&M record. He is the only Aggie to ever lead the school in tackles for four consecutive years. It is widely acknowledged that Nguyen was the undisputed on-field leader of the famous "Wrecking Crew" defense, as well as being its most famous and decorated player.
In 1995, he was named Southwest Conference Defensive Newcomer of the Year. From 1996 to 1998, he earned first-team All-Big 12 honors three consecutive times. In 1997, he was named Aggies MVP. In 1998, he was named a consensus All-American by every awarding publication, won the Bednarik Award for College Defensive Player of the Year, and the Lombardi Award for Outstanding College Lineman. Nguyen was also selected as a finalist for the Butkus Award, eventually becoming first runner-up. Nguyen missed winning the Butkus Award by a single vote out of more than 45 votes cast. It remains to date the closest vote in Butkus Award history. He was named Defensive Player of the Game for the 1998 Cotton Bowl after recording a bowl-record 12 tackles, including three tackles for a loss, and an interception, which he lateraled to a teammate for a touchdown. The Dallas Morning News named him Big 12 Male Athlete of the Year in 1998, and he earned Defensive Player of the Year honors in the Big 12 Conference. He also won the Jack Lambert Award in 1998. That same year, Texas A&M won the Big 12 championship game against Kansas State which is to date their last conference title. In 2005, he was named to the Big 12 Conference's 10th Anniversary Team. In 2010, he was voted on to the AP All-Time Big 12 Team tying with former University of Texas player Derrick Johnson for most votes at linebacker (19 out of 20.) Nguyen is generally acknowledged as the best defensive player in Texas A&M football history and one of the greatest defensive players of all time in the history of the Big 12 Conference. In 2004, Nguyen was inducted in the Texas A&M Athletics Hall Of Fame.[1] In April 2007, Nguyen was also inducted into the Texas Sports Hall of Fame and the AT&T Cotton Bowl Hall Of Fame.
On January 9, 2017, the National Football Foundation announced Nguyen was elected to the College Football Hall of Fame,[2] an impressive class that included Peyton Manning, Adrian N. Peterson, Marshall Faulk, Steve Spurrier, and Brian Urlacher.
Professional career
Dallas CowboysThe Dallas Cowboys drafted Nguyen in the third round (85th overall) of the 1999 NFL draft.
Nguyen made an impact with the Cowboys from the beginning, leading the team in special teams tackles (18) as a rookie and becoming the Cowboys' starting middle linebacker in his second season, after Randall Godfrey left via free agency.
In 2000, he played 10 games (five starts) and registered 64 tackles, after missing six contests with a sprained knee and losing his starting job to Barron Wortham. The next year, he completed his first full season as a starter and finished with a team-leading 172 tackles.
In 2002, while playing against the Houston Texans in the season opener, he suffered a broken wrist that forced him to miss the next eight games. Despite the serious injury, he finished the Texans game with a team-high 11 tackles (one for a loss) and one sack.
When head coach Bill Parcells arrived in 2003, he was critical of the linebackers in the Cowboys roster, joking publicly: "If this were the circus, we could fit them all into one of those Volkswagens that 10 clowns climb out of." The next season, he would pay Nguyen a compliment when he said: "He's a football playing dude, that guy. ... You bet he could have played for any of my teams".

*KICK:Barry195
In 2003, with Nguyen leading the team in tackles, the Cowboys were the second-most effective defense in the NFL and he was selected second-team All-Pro by the Associated Press. In 2004, Parcells implemented his preferred 3–4 defense and Nguyen repeated as the team's leading tackler, but the additional hits he received in this scheme started to affect his health.
In 2005, he started the first four games before suffering a neck injury that sidelined him for three games. He returned as a nickel linebacker and played in four more games, before being placed on the injured reserve list on November 28, after the Thanksgiving Day overtime loss against the Denver Broncos. He finished the season with 31 tackles and one sack in eight appearances.
Nguyen officially retired from the NFL on March 3, 2006, after a neck injury and knee problems, which hindered his performance, failed to improve. He led the team in tackles three times, in 2001, 2003, and 2004, and amassed 516 tackles in seven seasons, despite missing half of two separate seasons to injury.[3] As of November 2010, Dat Nguyen currently ranks 10th all-time in Cowboys recorded history for career total tackles. For his NFL career, he was named to the 2013 class of Texas Gridiron Legends.[4]
Coaching career
Dallas CowboysIn February 2007, Cowboys head coach Wade Phillips announced the hiring of Nguyen as assistant linebackers coach and defensive quality control coach. Along with Phillips' son Wes, Nguyen was the first assistant hired under Phillips.[5][6] Nguyen left the Cowboys on January 27, 2010.[7]
Texas A&MNguyen was named the inside linebackers coach at Texas A&M University on February 12, 2010.[8] In Nguyen's first year as the A&M inside linebackers coach, the Aggies went 9–3 in the regular season with wins over nationally ranked Oklahoma and Nebraska, as well as wins over Texas and Texas Tech. This marked the first time in school history that A&M had beaten all four of those teams in a single season. The resurgence of the Texas A&M defense to its former glory as the "Wrecking Crew" and particularly the outstanding play of the linebacker corps has been cited as a major reason for the team's 2010 season success.
Nguyen helped cement linebacker Von Miller's status in Texas A&M history by coaching him in the 2010 season, which led to Miller being awarded the 2010 Butkus Award.
At the conclusion of the 2011 season, Nguyen chose to leave Texas A&M, telling the Houston Chronicle's Brent Zwerneman that there was "no chance" of him being retained on Kevin Sumlin's staff.[9]
Personal lifeNguyen married his college sweetheart, Becky, and they have three daughters and twin boys. His family are Roman Catholics and attends mass at St. Peter the Apostle Catholic Church in Boerne, Texas.[10] In May 2004, Nguyen was awarded a Golden Torch Award at the Vietnamese American National Gala in Washington, D.C. He was also featured in HBO's Hard Knocks. In 2012, he became cohost with Jasson Minnix of an afternoon sports talk program on ESPN in San Antonio.[11] In March 2016, Nguyen became an Owner/Operator of a Chick Fil-A franchise located at Montgomery Plaza in Fort Worth, Texas.

United StatesU.S. Figure Skating is the national governing body for the sport of figure skating in the United States. It is recognized as such by the United States Olympic & Paralympic Committee "USOPC" under the Ted Stevens Olympic and Amateur Sports Act and is the United States member of the International Skating Union ("ISU"). Although the name of the organization is “the United States Figure Skating Association” it is now known as and conducts business under the name “U.S. Figure Skating.” Founded in 1921, U.S. Figure Skating regulates and governs the sport and defines and maintains the standard of skating proficiency. It specifies the rules for testing, competitions, and all other figure skating related activities. U.S. Figure Skating promotes interest and participation in the sport by assisting member clubs, skaters, and athletes, appointing officials, organizing competitions, exhibitions, and other figure skating pursuits, and offering a wide variety of programs.[1]
Athletes and officials who represent the United States at international figure skating competitions are selected by U.S. Figure Skating.
The Association is a non-profit organization.

USFSA Logo (1964–2003).
In 1921 the United States Figure Skating Association[2][3] was formed and became a member of the International Skating Union.[4] At the time of its formation, the Association was composed of seven (7) charter member clubs including: Beaver Dam Winter Sports Club,[5] The Skating Club of Boston,[6] Chicago Figure Skating Club[7] The Skating Club of New York,[8] Philadelphia Skating Club and Humane Society,[9] Sno Birds of Lake Placid,[10] and Twin City Figure Skating Club (which became the Figure Skating Club of Minneapolis in 1929).[11]
Since its inception through 1947, the governance activities of the Association were centered in New York City. The annual Governing Council meetings, as well as the annual Executive Committee meetings, were all held in New York City. In 1949 the Association transferred its offices to Chicago, Illinois. The offices were again moved, this time to Boston, in 1950. In 1979, the Association moved into its current headquarters in Colorado Springs, Colorado. This followed the USOC's move to Colorado Springs a year earlier in July 1978.[12]

In the 1930s, the Association made an effort to increase the number of competitive events by creating the three sectional championships, Eastern (1938), Midwestern (1933), and Pacific Coast (1936).[13]
In 1959, the Eastern and Pacific Coast Sections expanded their qualifying competitions by adding three Sub-Sectionals Championships each. The Eastern Section created the New England, North Atlantic, and South Atlantic Regions, while the Pacific Coast Section established the Central Pacific, Northwest, and Southwest Pacific Regions. It wasn't until 1962 that the Midwestern Sectional finally added their regional championships to the qualifying competition cycle.[14]
The abbreviated name, "USFSA" was first used in April 1921 and trademarked in 1972.[15] The distinctive shield logo was adopted in 1964[16] and used until 2003 when U.S. Figure Skating instituted its current logo.[17]
In 2006, the Executive Committee was eliminated.[18] At the same time the Board of Directors was reduced to sixteen members from its previous 29 members.
As of May 5, 2007, the Association officially adopted the name "U.S. Figure Skating" and dropped the abbreviated name of "USFSA".[19][20]
GovernanceU.S. Figure Skating is an association of clubs, governed by its members and its elected officers at national, regional and club levels.[21] As of June 2011, U.S. Figure Skating had 688 member, collegiate, and school-affiliated clubs[22] and a membership of 180,452.[22] Each member club may send delegates to the annual Governing Council meeting.
Governing CouncilU.S. Figure Skating has a representational government. Clubs and individual members appoint delegates. The number of delegates representing a club and the individual members depends on the prior year's paid registered member. Athlete delegate representation is required to be 20 percent of the prior year's registered delegate and proxy votes. Collectively these delegates meet annually (typically early May) to review, amend and ratify the actions taken by the Board since the prior year's Governing Council. This annual meeting of the appointed delegates is called the Governing Council.[23]
Board of DirectorsThe Board of Directors is charged with the management of the business and affairs of U.S. Figure Skating. It is currently composed of sixteen (16) members including: the president, three (3) vice presidents (one from each section), the secretary, the treasurer, four (4) group coordinators, two (2) coaches, and four (4) athletes.[24]
PresidentsSamuel Auxier is the current president of U.S. Figure Skating. He began his term in 2022. The prior presidents are listed below.[25]

He is charged with carrying out the policies, programs, and goals of the association as approved by the Board of Directors.[27]

FinanceThe Association is a non-profit organization.[29] As of June 30, 2011, U.S. Figure Skating had revenue, support, and gains of approximately $24.9 million derived primarily from dues, admissions and activity fees, skating events, sponsorships, broadcast and licensing, publications, grants, and other sources. The association expended approximately $12.9 million on its various programs and services plus an additional $2.4 million on management and general administrative expenses, under which the departments listed under the “Operations – Departments” are included.[30]
OfficialsMember clubs arrange to hold test sessions and competitions. The competitions are conducted under the supervision and authority of U.S. Figure Skating appointed officials. The member club (for competitions, the club is sometimes called the local organizing committee or “LOC”) is responsible for many of the ancillary functions of the test session or competition (registration, transportation, event monitoring, hospitality, messengers, copying, etc.). For national and international events, U.S. Figure Skating headquarters staff also provides logistics and event support. The officials are responsible for actually running the test sessions, competitions, and associated individual events. All the officials at test sessions and competitions are unpaid volunteers.[31]
Officials receive their appointments from U.S. Figure Skating after demonstrating a certain level of proficiency, and in some cases, after trialing or taking written examinations. In most cases, officials are appointed at three (3) levels; regional, sectional, and national.[32]

    6.0TestingTesting allows figure skaters to demonstrate that they have achieved a certain level of skating proficiency. Tests progress in increasing difficulty and focus on power, strength, speed, quickness, flow, extension, and edge quality and control.[36] Tests are conducted under the auspices of member clubs and administered during test sessions. Usually, three (3) test judges (the judge panel),[37] of appropriate level, determine the outcome of the tests on a pass / retry basis. Tests up to a certain level may be judged by a single, sufficiently qualified, judge.[37] Some higher-level dance tests require judges certified in dance judging to attend. The member club is responsible for reporting the results to U.S. Figure Skating.[38] U.S. Figure appoints test judges at various levels (bronze, silver, and gold) based on trial judging and their judging experience. According to their level, test judges are qualified to determine the outcome of increasingly difficult tests. Test judges are invited by the member club to participate in a given test session. Skaters’ testing levels passed determines at what level they may compete. For qualifying competitions, skaters must pass the free skate test at the level for which they intend to compete. U.S. Figure Skating still offers tests in compulsory figures, however, this discipline was last competed at a national championship competition in 1999.[39]
Singles and adult skaters must show they are proficient at a given level by passing two (2) tests at each level, moves in the field ("MIF") and free skate ("FS"). Additional test are conducted in the pairs skating, free dance and pattern dance discipline. Each member of a synchronized skating team must pass the appropriate test of single's competitor.
Tests must be completed in the order of increasing difficulty. They may not be taken out of turn.[40] However, a singles skater may take as many moves-in-the-field tests before taking any free skate tests.[41] Once a free skate test is passed, a competitor may only compete at that level at qualifying competitions. There are four (4) test levels specific to adult figure skating.[42] Adult skater must be twenty-one (21) years of age or older.[43]

International competitionsU.S. Figure Skating selects the athletes and officials that represent the United States at international figure skating competitions (Team USA). These competitions include the ISU Junior Grand Prix, Four Continents Figure Skating Championships, the ISU Grand Prix, the World Synchronized Skating Championships, the World Figure Skating Championships, and the Olympic Games.[55] Although the participants for Worlds and the Olympics are most often the top placers at US Nationals, there have been several times when other skaters have been selected due to injuries preventing them from competing at Nationals; Nancy Kerrigan being selected for the 1994 Olympics over 2nd-place finisher Michelle Kwan is one example. Most recently 2014 4th-place finisher Ashley Wagner was selected over 3rd place Mirai Nagasu ostensibly because of Wagner's more consistent international record; however because of Wagner's many endorsement contracts her selection has raised concerns about the fairness of the process (since U.S. Championships are not used as a straightforward Olympic trials).[56][57]
SponsorsU.S. Figure Skating has a number of sponsors, suppliers, and licensees that provide support to the association either financially or by supplying other goods and services.

Memorial Fund
*LIST:
Formation and purposeOn February 15, 1961, the entire United States figure skating team was killed when Sabena Flight 548 crashed en route from New York City to Brussels, Belgium.[66] The team was going to participate in the 1961 World Figure Skating Championships in Prague, Czechoslovakia. Among the team members that perished were 18 athletes, seven coaches and managers, three judges and referees, and six team family members.[67] Within one week of the tragedy, the association announced the formation of a memorial fund in honor of the lost team members.[68]"The mission of the Memorial Fund is to provide qualified U.S. Figure Skating members in need of financial aid with monetary assistance to pursue their goals both inside and outside the competitive arena. The fund is committed to awarding skating and academic scholarships to those athletes who have demonstrated excellent competitive results and/or academic achievements, and who have potential in national and international competitions."[69]
RISEIn 2009, U.S. Figure Skating commissioned the production of a full-length feature documentary film commemorating the 50th anniversary of the loss of the 1961 U.S. World Figure Skating Championship team and exalting figure skating in the U.S.[70] The movie, RISE, was produced and directed by the Emmy-award-winning company, Lookalike Productions of Englewood, NJ.[71] The film was released on February 17, 2011, for a one-night presentation through NCM Fathom.[72] It was shown again for an encore presentation on March 7, 2011.[73] Proceeds of the movie were used to further the mission of the Memorial Fund.[70]

Occupation	Comedian
Known for	ambush interviewsGeri Hall (born May 2, 1972 in Oakville, Ontario)[1][2] is a Canadian actress and comedian.
She has appeared on the CBC's This Hour has 22 Minutes in October and November 2004, March 2007 and became a permanent cast anchor in October 2007. Other appearances include the Rick Mercer Report and numerous television commercials. She wrote the Gemini Award-nominated To Die 4. She is known for her distinctive voice. She has appeared in The Blobheads on CBC.[3]
Geri Hall is also known for her attempt to interview Prime Minister Stephen Harper for the CBC comedy series 22 Minutes during the 2008 federal election campaign in Halifax, Nova Scotia on September 12, 2008. Hall, who was in character as "Single Female Voter", was restrained by security and later taken away in handcuffs. She was not arrested and instead got an exclusive interview with Harper, who said he had never watched 22 Minutes, and asked Hall: "Do you like handcuffs?"[4]    They were really going to take me to the station, because they maybe didn't know who I was or maybe did know who I was, depends on how you want to believe it.    — Geri Hall describing her encounter with the RCMPHall did a similar stunt on March 4, 2009 when she attempted to poke fun at Ontario Premier Dalton McGuinty's new rule requiring reporters to stand five feet back. It was poorly received due to Hall attempting it in the middle of questions on U.S. Steel's decision to shut down several mills. New Democrat MPP Peter Kormos was visibly angry and yelled at Hall to "Get the hell out of here". Kormos later said "The timing of it was totally inappropriate, you've got a press gallery trying to hold the premier accountable when a few thousand workers just lost their jobs." McGuinty's office said Hall's timing showed a "lack of judgment".[5][6] 22 Minutes executive producer Mark Farrell defended Hall and claims Hall wouldn't have known what McGuinty was speaking about beforehand. Farrell says she was doing what she always does (and what former 22 Minutes co-host Mary Walsh did before her)—waiting for a signal from organizers that the session was about to wrap up. "We always try to get in at the last question."[7]

Maudsley family therapy
Other names	Maudsley approach
[edit on Wikidata]
Maudsley family therapy also known as family-based treatment or Maudsley approach, is a family therapy for the treatment of anorexia nervosa devised by Christopher Dare and colleagues at the Maudsley Hospital in London. A comparison of family to individual therapy was conducted with eighty anorexia patients. The study showed family therapy to be the more effective approach in patients under 18 and within 3 years of the onset of their illness.[1] Subsequent research confirmed the efficacy of family-based treatment for teens with anorexia nervosa.[2][3][4][5] Family-based treatment has been adapted for bulimia nervosa and showed promising results in a randomized controlled trial comparing it to supportive individual therapy.[6]
Maudsley Family Therapy is an evidence-based approach to the treatment of anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa whose efficacy has been supported by empirical research.[7]

    5 External linksPhases of treatmentThe Maudsley Approach proceeds through three clearly defined phases. The process is divided into 15–20 treatment sessions and takes about 12 months to complete.[8] Daniel Le Grange, PhD and James Lock, MD, PhD describe the treatment as follows:"The Maudsley approach can mostly be construed as an intensive outpatient treatment where parents play an active and positive role in order to: Help restore their child’s weight to normal levels expected given their adolescent’s age and height; hand the control over eating back to the adolescent, and; encourage normal adolescent development through an in-depth discussion of these crucial developmental issues as they pertain to their child.
More ‘traditional’ treatment of AN suggests that the clinician's efforts should be individually based. Strict adherents to the perspective of only individual treatment will insist that the participation of parents, whatever the format, is at best unnecessary, but worse still interference in the recovery process. In fact, many proponents of this approach would consider ‘family problems’ as part of the etiology of the AN. No doubt, this view might contribute to parents feeling themselves to blame for their child's illness. The Maudsley Approach opposes the notion that families are pathological or should be blamed for the development of AN. On the contrary, the Maudsley Approach considers the parents as a resource and essential in successful treatment for AN.
Phase I: Weight restorationIn Phase I (the "weight restoration phase"), therapy focuses on the consequences of anorexia-associated malnutrition, e.g., changes in growth hormone levels, cardiac dysfunction, and behavioral disturbances. The therapist assesses the family's typical interaction pattern and eating habits and assists the family in re-feeding their child. This may involve reestablishing the patient's relationships with their siblings and peers. Typically, the therapist will attend a family meal during this phase. Conducting a family meal serves at least two functions: (1) it allows the therapist to observe the family's typical interaction patterns around eating, and (2) it provides the therapist with an opportunity to assist the family in encouraging their adolescent to eat a restorative amount of food.
The therapist will spend phase I coaching the parents, supporting the adolescent, and realigning the adolescent with their siblings and peers. Parents are coached to adopt an attitude similar to that of an inpatient nursing team (sometimes termed "home hospital"). That is, parents are to express sympathy and understanding of their adolescent's ambivalence towards the eating disorder, while remaining steadfast in their expectation that the adolescent will work to restore a healthy weight. Realigning the adolescent with their siblings and peers involves helping the adolescent to form stronger and more age-appropriate relationships. This is essential in adolescence, as sibling and peer relationships are more central to the patient than parent–child relationships. Such realigned relationships lessen the possibility of the patient–parent relationship regressing to one defined by age-inappropriate dependency.
*LIST:
Throughout this phase, the therapist must anticipate and prevent parental criticism of the adolescent. In part, this is accomplished by modeling to the parents an uncritical stance toward the adolescent. This is a tenet of the Maudsley Approach: the adolescent is not to blame for their eating disorder behaviors, as these behaviors are symptoms largely outside the adolescent's control.
Phase II: Returning control over eating to the adolescentThe patient's acceptance of parental demand for increased food intake, steady weight gain, as well as a change in the mood of the family (i.e., relief at having taken charge of the eating disorder), all signal the start of Phase II of treatment.
This phase of treatment focuses on encouraging the parents to help their child to take more control over eating once again. The therapist advises the parents to accept that the main task here is the return of their child to physical health, and that this now happens mostly in a way that is in keeping with their child's age and their parenting style. Although symptoms remain central in the discussions between the therapist and the family, weight gain with minimum tension is encouraged. In addition, all other general family relationship issues or difficulties in terms of day-to-day adolescent or parenting concerns that the family has had to postpone can now be brought forward for review. This, however, occurs only in relationship to the effect these issues have on the parents in their task of assuring steady weight gain. For example, the patient may want to go out with her friends to have dinner and a movie. However, while the parents are still unsure whether their child would eat entirely on their own accord, they might be required to have dinner with her parents and then be allowed to join friends for a movie.
Phase III: Establishing healthy adolescent identityPhase III is initiated when the adolescent is able to maintain weight above 95% of ideal weight on their own and self-starvation has abated.
Treatment focus starts to shift to the impact the eating disorder has had on the individual establishing a healthy adolescent identity. This entails a review of central issues of adolescence and includes supporting increased personal autonomy for the adolescent, the development of appropriate parental boundaries, as well as the need for the parents to reorganize their life together after their children's prospective departure."[9]
Evidence-based strategyTo date there have been four randomized controlled trials of Maudsley Family Therapy. The first (Russell et al., 1987) compared the Maudsley Model to individual therapy and found that family-based treatment was more effective for patients under 19 years of age with less than three years duration of illness. Ninety percent of these patients achieved a normal weight or the return of menses at the end of treatment including at five year follow-up (Eisler, et al., 1997). Two further randomised trials compared standard Maudsley treatment with a modified version where the patients and parents were seen separately (Le Grange et al. 1992, Eisler et al., 2000). In these trials approximately 70% of patients returned to a normal body weight (>90% IBW) or experienced the return of menses at the end of treatment, regardless of which version of the model was employed. Results from a more recent randomised controlled trial suggest that results are maintained with the manualisation of the Maudsley approach (Lock & Le Grange, 2001). There is also evidence that a short (six months) and a long course (one year) of treatment results in a similar positive outcome (Lock et al., 2005). Finally, the outcome using family-based treatment appears just as positive for children (9–12 years old) as it does for adolescents (Lock et al., 2006).[10]

Website	elginok.ok.schoolwebpages.comElgin Public Schools is a school district in Elgin, Oklahoma.
HistorySchool District No. 16, County of Comanche, Oklahoma Territory, was formed April 3, 1902. In June 1902 a one-story schoolhouse and other out building were constructed. A. T. Kellison was hired as the first teacher at a salary of $40 per month. By 1908, since enrollment of the school had increased to 80 pupils and 110 in 1909, it was obvious that more space was needed. Constructed of a new brick building began and the new building was occupied in the spring of 1910. The school became accredited in 1928, the first school buses began their daily route in 1935, a hot lunch program also started in 1935, and the first cafeteria begin in 1948, in a building remodeled from an army hospital. In 1937 the first edition of the Elgin Chat was distributed.When school opened in September 1925, enrollment was 25 pupils in the high school with all the grades showing an enrollment of 70 pupils. Enrollment in 1937 had jumped to a total of 238, with 130 in high school and 108 in the grade school. During the 100 years of Elgin School's existence, the Elgin School campus continued its growth, both in student enrollment, but also in new buildings. The growth of the Elgin Schools is a direct compliment to the dedicated early pioneers who wanted an educated for their children and pursued that dream with the result that many of their children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren still attend the school system begun by their ancestors.In 2002 the Elgin school system celebrated 100 years of providing education to the residents of the Elgin school district Elgin Public Schools has changed dramatically over the years. Our school district spans 200.5 square miles. We encourage you to come by and see the growth that is happening daily at Elgin Public Schools.[1]
